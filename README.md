# Loan-Defaulter-Prediction
### Objective:
* The goal of this “loan defaulter prediction” is to detect the probability of defaulter rate using Machine learning techniques.
* I understand the customer’s behavior before giving the loan.
* Help to make more informed credit scoring decisions and reduce the rate of defaulters.

Here I am  using Logistic regression to predict the loan defaulter in R using key features like Age, Education, Income, Credit debt, etc
